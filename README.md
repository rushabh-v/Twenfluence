# Twenfluence - Twitter + Influence

![logo](img/logo.png)

__A Twitter app to get list of the experts for a particular domain/topic.__

### Working

Users need to search for any hashtag (i.e, climatechage, covid, etc.). The app will process all the tweets with that hashtag and their authors, and based on their profiles, tweets, the reactions on those tweets it wil figure out top experts in that domain with the stastical data regarding why it thinks those people are the experts. It will also render the top tweets with that hashtag.

Note: It's not hosted, currently. But it will be live at http://www.twenfluence.tech/ soon.
